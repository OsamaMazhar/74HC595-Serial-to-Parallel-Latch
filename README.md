# 74HC595 Based Serial-to-Parallel Latch

This project utilizes 74HC595 to develop a serial-to-parallel latch. The IC requires on three hardware connections with the micrcontroller (may it be 8051 family or any other) and can extend the output hardware pins "theoretically" to infinite numbers. This project is very useful when developing our own displays with 7-segments or LED Matrix. Also it is useful for use with development boards like Arduino as they have limited I/O pins usually. Following is the link to the youtube video of this project which explains the concept and the code in sufficient detail:
